<h1>Jadon Sancho introduction</h1>
<p>Jadon Malik Sancho (born 25 March 2000) is an English professional footballer who plays as a winger for German Bundesliga club Borussia Dortmund and the England national team. A highly technical, creative player, he is known for his trickery, pace and use of feints in one-on-one situations and has been described as one of the world's best young players.[5][6] He came runner-up for the 2019 Kopa Trophy and was nominated to the 40-man shortlist for the 2020 Golden Boy.[7]

Previously a youth player with Watford and Manchester City, Sancho signed his first senior contract with Dortmund in 2017. In his second season, he established himself as a first-team regular and was named in the 2018–19 Bundesliga Team of the Season. Ahead of the 2019–20 season, Sancho won his first trophy following the DFL-Supercup victory over Bayern Munich.

Sancho was part of the England youth team that won the 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup and made his debut for the senior team in 2018.</p>
